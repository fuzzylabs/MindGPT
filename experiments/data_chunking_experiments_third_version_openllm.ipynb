      "What is depression?\n",
      "Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary.\n",

      "If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings.\n",

      "When does low mood become depression?\n",
      "We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own.\n",

      "\n",
      "Are there different types of depression?\n",
      "If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too:\n",
      "\n",
      "Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression.\n",
      "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that occurs at a particular time of year, or during a particular season. See our page on SAD for more information.\n",
      "Antenatal depression. This is depression that occurs while you are pregnant. It is sometimes called prenatal depression.\n",
      "Postnatal depression (PND). This is depression that occurs in the first year after having a baby. This can include affecting dads and partners.\n",
      "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). This is a hormone-related disorder that affects your body but also how you feel. This can involve experiencing depression. So your doctor may describe this as a mental health problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "These kinds of experiences can feel very real at the time. This might make it hard to understand that these experiences are also symptoms of your depression. And they can be frightening or upsetting, so it's important to seek treatment and support.\n",

      "Context: Overview - Depression in adults Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people .\n",
      "\n",
      "How to tell if you have depression Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "When to see a doctor It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treating depression Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Living with depression Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive.\n",

      "Symptoms - Depression in adults The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychological symptoms The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness feeling hopeless and helpless having low self-esteem feeling tearful feeling guilt-ridden feeling irritable and intolerant of others having no motivation or interest in things finding it difficult to make decisions not getting any enjoyment out of life feeling anxious or worried having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical symptoms The physical symptoms of depression include: moving or speaking more slowly than usual changes in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased) constipation unexplained aches and pains lack of energy low sex drive ( loss of libido ) disturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "Social symptoms The social symptoms of depression include: avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities neglecting your hobbies and interests having difficulties in your home, work or family life\n",
      "\n",
      "Severities of depression Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong. Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are how long depression lasts the impact on your daily life A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grief and depression It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other types of depression There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period\n",
      "\n",
      "When to seek help See a GP if you experience symptoms of depression for most of the day, every day, for more than 2 weeks. A low mood may improve after a short time.\n",

      "Context: Overview - Depression in adults Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people .\n",
      "\n",
      "How to tell if you have depression Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "When to see a doctor It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treating depression Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Living with depression Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive.\n",

      "Symptoms - Depression in adults The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychological symptoms The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness feeling hopeless and helpless having low self-esteem feeling tearful feeling guilt-ridden feeling irritable and intolerant of others having no motivation or interest in things finding it difficult to make decisions not getting any enjoyment out of life feeling anxious or worried having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical symptoms The physical symptoms of depression include: moving or speaking more slowly than usual changes in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased) constipation unexplained aches and pains lack of energy low sex drive ( loss of libido ) disturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning\n",
      "\n",
      "Social symptoms The social symptoms of depression include: avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities neglecting your hobbies and interests having difficulties in your home, work or family life\n",
      "\n",
      "Severities of depression Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong. Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are how long depression lasts the impact on your daily life A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grief and depression It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other types of depression There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period\n",

      "Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary.\n",

      "We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own.\n",

      "\n",
      "Are there different types of depression?\n",
      "If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time.\n",

      "Finding it difficult to concentrate\n",
      "Struggling to sleep\n",

      "\n",
      "Self-harm and suicidal feelings\n",
      "If you're feeling low, you might self-harm to cope with difficult feelings. Although this might make you feel better in the short term, self-harm can be very dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you're feeling really low and hopeless, you may also find yourself thinking about suicide. This could be thinking about the idea of suicide, or considering a plan to end your life. These thoughts can feel difficult to control, and can be very frightening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychotic symptoms\n",
      "If you experience depression, you might also experience some psychotic symptoms. These may include delusions, such as paranoia. Or they may be hallucinations, such as hearing voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you experience psychotic symptoms as part of depression, they're likely to be linked to your depressed thoughts and feelings. This may include experiencing delusions relating to feelings of guilt. For example, you might become convinced that you've committed a crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "These kinds of experiences can feel very real at the time. This might make it hard to understand that these experiences are also symptoms of your depression. And they can be frightening or upsetting, so it's important to seek treatment and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might worry that experiencing psychotic symptoms could mean you’re given a diagnosis that doesn’t feel right for you. But discussing all of your symptoms with your doctor can help you get the right support and treatment.\n",

      "How might depression affect my day-to-day life?\n",
      "If you have depression, you might find that it interferes with different aspects of your life. For example, it might affect your ability to work, your relationships, or managing your finances. This can add extra stress to an already difficult experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may also feel hard to explain your thoughts and feelings to others. You might want to cut yourself off from other people instead. This could lead to you feeling isolated and lonely.\n",

Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms.

There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains.

At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression.

      "types of food and drink may affect how you feel. And it has tips for managing your diet when you’re feeling unwell. Try to do some physical activity. Many of us may find exercise difficult. But even lower intensity activities can help our mood. For example, doing yoga, swimming or walking. If you don't feel confident doing exercise, you could start off with smaller activities and build from there. It may help to begin with gentle stretches or chair-based exercises.  Try to avoid recreational drugs and alcohol. You might feel like using recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings about yourself. But in the long run, these might make you feel worse. And they could prevent you from dealing with underlying problems.  Try to care for your hygiene It may feel difficult to look after your hygiene when you’re experiencing depression. But small things could make a big difference to how you feel. For example, this could be taking a shower, brushing your teeth and getting dressed. If you don’t feel able to do these things, there may be ways to make them feel easier. For example, you could: Use mouthwash instead of brushing your teeth. Use wet wipes and dry shampoo if you don’t feel up to having a shower. Try putting on clean socks and underwear or changing into clean pyjamas, if getting fully dressed feels too hard. Use a fabric spray to freshen up clothes and bedding, if you’re struggling to keep up with doing laundry. You may also find it helpful to create a hygiene kit where you can keep everything you need in one place. This might include things like a toothbrush and toothpaste, deodorant, a hairbrush or soap. I try to keep active, even if that's just getting out of bed, washed and ready before 10 am, so that the days don't become an endless blur of nothingness. Spend time in nature. Spending time in nature can help with mental health problems like depression. If you’re struggling to leave the house and get outside, opening a window to get some fresh air with our mental health. But eating regularly can keep your blood sugar stable and really make a difference to your mood and energy levels. For more tips see our pages on food and mood. I put on weight since I started medication so I have started eating really healthily. I think this has helped my depression too. Try some physical activity. Physical activity can have a positive impact on our mood. It can be really helpful to focus on your body and physical surroundings. Moving your body may also help you to sleep better. Activities may include: A regular walk outdoors. Swimming. Yoga or meditation. Health walks are organised locally in some areas. Your GP surgery may organise a weekly walking group. Some doctors will also prescribe an exercise programme.  Exercise is very important. If I feel I have too much energy, swimming or a fast long walk can really calm me down and help me sleep. On a low day I might not be up for a swim, but a walk into town really helps me bring my mind and body together. Visit a recovery college. You may also find it helpful to find a recovery college. They offer courses about mental health and recovery in a supportive environment. You can find local providers on the Mind Recovery Net website . can tell you whether depression is a side effect. Or you could ask your doctor or pharmacist about any side effects. If you think medication is causing your depression, you can talk to your doctor about taking an alternative. This is especially if you're expecting your treatment to last for a long time. Recreational drugs and alcohol. Alcohol and recreational drugs can both contribute to depression. Some of us may use them to make ourselves feel better or distract ourselves. But they can make us feel worse in the long term.  Sleep, diet and exercise. Some of us may struggle with sleeping, getting active, or keeping a healthy diet. And if we find these things difficult, it can affect our mood. These things are unlikely to cause depression on their own. But they could make us more vulnerable to it.\n",

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day. Try to get up at your normal time and stick to your routine as much as possible. Not having a routine can affect your eating. Try to carry on cooking and eating regular meals.

      "What is depression? Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave. The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary. If you experience milder depression, you might have low mood but still be able to carry on with your daily life. But things may feel harder and less worthwhile. If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings . It starts as sadness then I feel myself shutting down, becoming less capable of coping. Eventually, I just feel numb and empty. When does low mood become depression? We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own. But it might be depression if the feelings become so bad that they interfere with our daily life. Or if they last for several weeks or months.  I learnt to cope by telling myself I don't care. Telling myself emphatically that nothing was important, I just don’t care, was my way of coping Read David's story Are there different types of depression? If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that occurs at a particular time of year, or during a particular season.  Antenatal depression. This is What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less worthwhile. At its most severe, depression can make you feel suicidal , and be life-threatening. Some types occur during or after pregnancy (antenatal and postnatal depression), or may come back each year around the same time (seasonal affective disorder). To find out more see our pages on: depression. postnatal depression (PND). seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Bringing back joy to fight depression. On bad days, I exist in a world that seems devoid of any colour... Read Eleanor's story Anxiety problems. Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. Occasional anxiety is a normal human experience. But if your feelings of anxiety are very strong, or last for a long time, they can be overwhelming. You might also experience physical symptoms such as sleep problems and panic attacks . You might be diagnosed with a particular anxiety disorder, such as generalised anxiety disorder your mood. But antidepressants don't work for everyone. And there is no scientific evidence that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance which is corrected by antidepressants. What different types of antidepressant are there? There are several different types of antidepressant. They mostly affect the same brain chemicals and cause similar effects. But some people may respond to certain antidepressants better than others. And the different drugs may cause different side effects. The different types are: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). tricyclics. monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). other antidepressants.  Or see our antidepressants A–Z for detailed information on individual antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) About SSRIs: SSRIs mainly work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin into the nerve cell that released it. This means that the serotonin acts for longer on your brain and body. You may find the side effects of SSRIs easier to cope with than with other antidepressants. But these effects can still feel unpleasant, especially when you first start taking the drugs. SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant in the UK. Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) About SNRIs: SNRIs work in a similar way to SSRIs. But they also have a significant effect on your noradrenaline reuptake, as well as your serotonin reuptake. Like SSRIs, you may find that you can take SNRIs without experiencing too many unwanted side effects. But their side effects can still be unpleasant. SNRIs are sometimes preferred for treating more severe depression and anxiety. Tricyclics About tricyclics: Like SNRIs, tricyclics affect your reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin, making their effects on your brain and body last longer. But tricyclics also affect some other chemicals in your body. This can mean they’re more likely to cause unpleasant side effects\n",

You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period. When to seek help. See a GP if you experience symptoms of medicines that treat the symptoms of depression . There are many different types of antidepressant. They have to be prescribed by a doctor, usually for depression that's moderate or severe. Combination therapy. A GP may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy, particularly if your depression is quite severe. A combination of an antidepressant and CBT usually works better than having just one of these treatments. Mental health teams. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Behavioural activation. Behavioural activation therapy focuses on identifying links Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression.

      "Try mindfulness. Practising mindfulness could help you manage unwanted thoughts and reduce stress.  I made a decision that I was going to accept I have PMDD and make positive lifestyle changes to try and live as happily and stress-free as I could. It took a few years and was not an easy process. Now I work part-time nannying, but on my terms. A complete turnaround from my previous jobs. If I focused on the negative of these choices I might say it's not the life I had planned for myself, but I try not to dwell on this. Look after your physical health. Try to get enough sleep.

I gave up red meat and try to eat no sugar and drink hardly any alcohol. I exercise when I can and find meditation and yoga really helpful. Reasonable adjustments If your PMDD affects your ability to work, study or access services, consider asking for reasonable adjustments. One of the criteria for a PMDD diagnosis is that it has a significant impact on your work, social, education or family life.

It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave. The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary. If you experience milder depression, you might have low mood but still be able to carry on with your daily life. But things may feel harder and less worthwhile. If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings .

There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine.\n",

      "depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is.

They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression.

Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you support and an insight into your own depression.

      "What is depression? Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave. The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary. If you experience milder depression, you might have low mood but still be able to carry on with your daily life. But things may feel harder and less worthwhile. If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings . It starts as sadness then I feel myself shutting down, becoming less capable of coping. Eventually, I just feel numb and empty. When does low mood become depression? We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own. But it might be depression if the feelings become so bad that they interfere with our daily life. Or if they last for several weeks or months.  I learnt to cope by telling myself I don't care. Telling myself emphatically that nothing was important, I just don’t care, was my way of coping Read David's story Are there different types of depression? If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’.

Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults.

      "yourself. But taking steps to look after your physical health can make a difference to how you feel: Try to get good sleep. For many of us who experience depression, we might struggle to fall asleep. Or we may find that we sleep too much. But getting good sleep can help to improve our mood and increase our energy levels. You may find it helpful to aim to wake up and go to bed at the same time each day.  Think about your diet. Our page on food and mental health has information about how different types of food and drink may affect how you feel. And it has tips for managing your diet when you’re feeling unwell. Try to do some physical activity. Many of us may find exercise difficult. But even lower intensity activities can help our mood. For example, doing yoga, swimming or walking. If you don't feel confident doing exercise, you could start off with smaller activities and build from there. It may help to begin with gentle stretches or chair-based exercises.  Try to avoid recreational drugs and alcohol. You might feel like using recreational drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings about yourself. But in the long run, these might make you feel worse. And they could prevent you from dealing with underlying problems.  Try to care for your hygiene It may feel difficult to look after your hygiene when you’re experiencing depression. But small things could make a big difference to how you feel. For example, this could be taking a shower, brushing your teeth and getting dressed. If you don’t feel able to do these things, there may be ways to make them feel easier. For example, you could: Use mouthwash instead of brushing your teeth. Use wet wipes and dry shampoo if you don’t feel up to having a shower. Try putting on clean socks and underwear or changing into clean pyjamas, if getting fully dressed feels too hard. Use a fabric spray to freshen up clothes and bedding, if you’re struggling to keep up with doing laundry. You may also find it helpful to create a could include things like: Gardening. Cleaning or tidying. Cooking. Crafts. Arts can be helpful in expressing your feelings, such as: Painting. Music. Writing. Making time in your day for other activities you enjoy, such as: Gaming. Reading. Watching films. For more ideas, see our pages on arts and creative therapies , nature and mental health , sleep problems , stress , relaxation and mindfulness . Think about your diet. It can be difficult to maintain a healthy diet when we’re struggling with our mental health. But eating regularly can keep your blood sugar stable and really make a difference to your mood and energy levels. For more tips see our pages on food and mood. I put on weight since I started medication so I have started eating really healthily. I think this has helped my depression too. Try some physical activity. Physical activity can have a positive impact on our mood. It can be really helpful to focus on your body and physical surroundings. Moving your body may also help you to sleep better. Activities may include: A regular walk outdoors. Swimming. Yoga or meditation. Health walks are organised locally in some areas. Your GP surgery may organise a weekly walking group. Some doctors will also prescribe an exercise programme.  Exercise is very important. If I feel I have too much energy, swimming or a fast long walk can really calm me down and help me sleep. On a low day I might not be up for a swim, but a walk into town really helps me bring my mind and body together. Visit a recovery college. You may also find it helpful to find a recovery college. They offer courses about mental health and recovery in a supportive environment. You can find local providers on the Mind Recovery Net website . What treatments are there for depression? This page covers: Self-help resources. Talking therapies. Medication. Other treatments for depression. What happens if medication or therapy aren't working? If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. I really struggled with the SSRIs, even though my GP told me that was the only course of action. They made me feel worse than I did to start with, then incredibly tired. I fought for a referral for CBT and in the end it saved me. Self-help resources. A self-help resource might be the first treatment option your doctor offers you. This is more likely if your depression is less severe. These resources can be accessed faster than other treatments. And they could help you feel better without needing to try other options. Your GP might recommend that you try one of the following: A guided self-help programme. These often focus on how your thoughts, feelings, beliefs and behaviour interact. And they can teach you skills to help you cope with how you feel. A healthcare professional should support you and check your progress through the programme. This support may be online, face-to-face or over the phone. A physical activity programme, such as a group exercise class. These classes are designed for people with depression. Your GP may also be able to help you access other exercise programmes for free or lower cost. Whether you can access this may depend on where you live, and your financial situation.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you support and an insight into your own depression. You may not feel comfortable about discussing your mental health and sharing your distress with others. If this is the case, writing about how you feel or expressing your emotions through poetry or art are other ways to help your mood. Here's a list of depression support groups and information about how to access them. Smoking, drugs and alcohol. If you have depression it may be tempting to smoke or drink to make you feel better. Cigarettes and alcohol may seem to help at first, but they make things worse in the long run. Be extra cautious with cannabis. You might think it's harmless, but research has shown a strong link between cannabis use and mental illness, including depression. A GP can give you advice and support if you drink or smoke too much or use drugs. You may also find the following pages useful: quit smoking. drug addiction: getting help. alcohol support. Work and finances. If your depression is caused by working too much or if it's affecting your ability to do your job, you may need time off to recover. It's important to avoid too much stress, and this includes work-related stress. If you're employed, you may be able to work shorter hours or work in a more flexible way, particularly if job pressures seem to trigger your symptoms. Under the Equality Act 2010, all employers must make reasonable adjustments to make the employment of people with disabilities possible. This can include people who've been diagnosed with a mental illness. Find out more about the Equality Act 2010 on the GOV.UK website .

      "What is depression? Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave. The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary. If you experience milder depression, you might have low mood but still be able to carry on with your daily life. But things may feel harder and less worthwhile. If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings . It starts as sadness then I feel myself shutting down, becoming less capable of coping. Eventually, I just feel numb and empty. When does low mood become depression? We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own. But it might be depression if the feelings become so bad that they interfere with our daily life. Or if they last for several weeks or months.  I learnt to cope by telling myself I don't care. Telling myself emphatically that nothing was important, I just don’t care, was my way of coping Read David's story Are there different types of depression? If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that occurs at a particular time of year, or during a particular season.  Antenatal depression. This is What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less worthwhile. At its most severe, depression can make you feel suicidal , and be life-threatening. Some types occur during or after pregnancy (antenatal and postnatal depression), or may come back each year around the same time (seasonal affective disorder).

On bad days, I exist in a world that seems devoid of any colour... Read Eleanor's story Anxiety problems. Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. Occasional anxiety is a normal human experience. But if your feelings of anxiety are very strong, or last for a long time, they can be overwhelming. You might also experience physical symptoms such as sleep problems and panic attacks . You might be diagnosed with a particular anxiety disorder, such as generalised anxiety disorder symptoms are sometimes called 'episodes'. You may experience depressive episodes, manic episodes, or both. You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis. But schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can involve similar symptoms and experiences. Diagnosing schizoaffective disorder can be complex. Not all professionals agree on how best to diagnose or describe it. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be considered if you’ve experienced: Symptoms that have lasted for a month or longer. Symptoms of psychosis and mood symptoms at the same time. Mood symptoms for most of the time that you've felt unwell. A period of time (usually at least 2 weeks) of symptoms of psychosis without mood symptoms. Depressive episodes that include low mood. Schizoaffective disorder is often seen as a psychotic disorder with significant mood features, rather than a mood disorder with psychosis. My problems were not picked up as a teenager, which resulted in a crisis in my early 20 s, involving hospital admissions and being severely mentally unwell. The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder seemed to fit with my experience better than any other 'label' or diagnosis. How is schizoaffective disorder diagnosed?

An overdose is also less likely to be serious. Fluoxetine is probably the best known SSRI (sold under the brand name Prozac). Other SSRIs include citalopram (Cipramil), escitalopram (Cipralex), paroxetine (Seroxat) and sertraline (Lustral). Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). SNRIs are similar to SSRIs.

I learnt to cope by telling myself I don't care. Telling myself emphatically that nothing was important, I just don’t care, was my way of coping Read David's story Are there different types of depression? If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis. But schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can involve similar symptoms and experiences. Diagnosing schizoaffective disorder can be complex.

There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are. how long depression lasts. the impact on your daily life. A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling develop it. It's thought that severe depression in particular may be partly caused by the genes you inherit from your parents. But depression is usually caused by a combination of triggers such as life events, so having a family history of depression does not always mean that you'll develop it. Pregnancy and giving birth. Some women are particularly vulnerable to depression after pregnancy. The hormonal and physical changes, as well as the added responsibility of a new life, can lead to postnatal depression . Sometimes depression starts before you give birth. Depression in pregnancy is known as antenatal depression. Menopause. Menopause is when your periods stop due to lower hormone levels. Sometimes menopause can trigger depression, particularly in the first few years. Menopause can also cause symptoms such as sadness and mood swings.

      "What is depression? Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave. The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary. If you experience milder depression, you might have low mood but still be able to carry on with your daily life. But things may feel harder and less worthwhile. If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings . It starts as sadness then I feel myself shutting down, becoming less capable of coping. Eventually, I just feel numb and empty. When does low mood become depression? We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own. But it might be depression if the feelings become so bad that they interfere with our daily life. Or if they last for several weeks or months.  I learnt to cope by telling myself I don't care. Telling myself emphatically that nothing was important, I just don’t care, was my way of coping Read David's story Are there different types of depression?

These are some common signs of depression that you may experience: How you might feel Down, upset or tearful. Restless, agitated or irritable. Guilty, worthless and down on yourself. Empty and numb. Isolated and unable to relate to other people. Finding no pleasure in life or things you usually enjoy. Angry or frustrated over minor things. A sense of unreality. No self-confidence or self-esteem. Hopeless and despairing. Feeling tired all the time. How you might act Avoiding social events and activities you usually enjoy. Self-harming or suicidal behaviour. Difficulty speaking, thinking clearly or making decisions. Losing interest in sex. Difficulty remembering or concentrating on things. Using more tobacco, alcohol or other drugs than usual. Difficulty sleeping, or sleeping too much. No appetite and losing weight, or eating more than usual and gaining weight. Physical aches and pains with no obvious physical cause.

I close the curtains in the evening and wish it was dark so I could go to bed early but it's broad daylight. I need to sleep and withdraw again from the world. Are there common misconceptions about SAD? Lots of people have heard of SAD, but this doesn't mean that they understand what it's like or how you're affected. It doesn't mean you 'just feel a bit low in winter'. There are many factors that can cause it or make it worse, and it can affect your life just as much as other types of depression.

      "Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults.

There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay.

But eating regularly can keep your blood sugar stable and really make a difference to your mood and energy levels. For more tips see our pages on food and mood. I put on weight since I started medication so I have started eating really healthily. I think this has helped my depression too. Try some physical activity.

Activities may include: A regular walk outdoors. Swimming. Yoga or meditation. Health walks are organised locally in some areas. Your GP surgery may organise a weekly walking group. Some doctors will also prescribe an exercise programme.  Exercise is very important. If I feel I have too much energy, swimming or a fast long walk can really calm me down and help me sleep.

Talking therapies. Medication. Other treatments for depression. What happens if medication or therapy aren't working? If you feel unable to keep yourself safe, it's a mental health emergency. I really struggled with the SSRIs, even though my GP told me that was the only course of action. They made me feel worse than I did to start with, then incredibly tired. I fought for a referral for CBT and in the end it saved me. Self-help resources. A self-help resource might be the first treatment option your doctor offers you. This is more likely if your depression is less severe. These resources can be accessed faster than other treatments. And they could help you feel better without needing to try other options.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch.

      "What is depression? Depression is a mental health problem that involves having a low mood or losing interest and enjoyment in things. It can also cause a range of other changes to how you feel or behave. The symptoms you experience may vary. How intense they are, how long they last, and how much they affect your daily life can also vary. If you experience milder depression, you might have low mood but still be able to carry on with your daily life. But things may feel harder and less worthwhile. If you have more severe depression, you might find day-to-day life much more difficult. You may also experience suicidal feelings . It starts as sadness then I feel myself shutting down, becoming less capable of coping. Eventually, I just feel numb and empty. When does low mood become depression? We all have times when our mood is low, and we feel sad or fed up. Often these feelings happen for a reason and pass on their own. But it might be depression if the feelings become so bad that they interfere with our daily life. Or if they last for several weeks or months.  I learnt to cope by telling myself I don't care. Telling myself emphatically that nothing was important, I just don’t care, was my way of coping Read David's story Are there different types of depression? If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that occurs at a particular time of year, or during a particular season.  Antenatal depression. This is What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less worthwhile. At its most severe, depression can make you feel suicidal , and be life-threatening. Some types occur during or after pregnancy (antenatal and postnatal depression), or may come back each year around the same time (seasonal affective disorder).

On bad days, I exist in a world that seems devoid of any colour... Read Eleanor's story Anxiety problems. Anxiety is what we feel when we are worried, tense or afraid – particularly about things that are about to happen, or which we think could happen in the future. Occasional anxiety is a normal human experience. But if your feelings of anxiety are very strong, or last for a long time, they can be overwhelming. You might also experience physical symptoms such as sleep problems and panic attacks . You might be diagnosed with a particular anxiety disorder, such as generalised anxiety disorder to your brain chemistry, antidepressants may lift your mood. But antidepressants don't work for everyone. And there is no scientific evidence that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance which is corrected by antidepressants. What different types of antidepressant are there? There are several different types of antidepressant. They mostly affect the same brain chemicals and cause similar effects. But some people may respond to certain antidepressants better than others. And the different drugs may cause different side effects. The different types are: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). tricyclics. monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). other antidepressants.  Or see our antidepressants A–Z for detailed information on individual antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) About SSRIs: SSRIs mainly work by blocking the reuptake of serotonin into the nerve cell that released it. This means that the serotonin acts for longer on your brain and body. You may find the side effects of SSRIs easier to cope with than with other antidepressants. But these effects can still feel unpleasant, especially when you first start taking the drugs. SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed type of antidepressant in the UK. Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) About SNRIs: SNRIs work in a similar way to SSRIs. But they also have a significant effect on your noradrenaline reuptake, as well as your serotonin reuptake. Like SSRIs, you may find that you can take SNRIs without experiencing too many unwanted side effects. But their side effects can still be unpleasant. SNRIs are sometimes preferred for treating more severe depression and anxiety. Tricyclics About tricyclics: Like SNRIs, tricyclics affect your reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin, making their effects on your brain and body last longer. But tricyclics also affect some other chemicals in your body. This can mean\n",

      "including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are. how long depression lasts. the impact on your daily life. A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period. When to Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with usually lasts for at least 6 months after you start to feel better. Some people with recurrent depression may be advised to take them indefinitely.  Side effects. Different antidepressants can have a range of different side effects. Always check the information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see what the possible side effects are. The most common side effects of antidepressants are usually mild. Side effects should improve within a few days or weeks of treatment, as the body gets used to the medicine.  cautions and interactions of antidepressants. Coming off antidepressants. Talk to your doctor before you stop taking antidepressants. It's important that you do not stop taking antidepressants suddenly. Once you're ready to come off antidepressants, your doctor will probably recommend reducing your dose gradually over several weeks – or longer, if you have been taking them for a long time. This is to help prevent any withdrawal symptoms you might get as a reaction to coming off the medicine.  Types of antidepressants. There are several different types of antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs are the most widely prescribed type of antidepressants. They're usually preferred over other antidepressants, as they cause fewer side effects. An overdose is also less likely to be serious. Fluoxetine is probably the best known SSRI (sold under the brand name Prozac). Other SSRIs include citalopram (Cipramil), escitalopram (Cipralex), paroxetine (Seroxat) and sertraline (Lustral). Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). SNRIs are similar to SSRIs. They were designed to be a more effective antidepressant than SSRIs. However, the evidence that SNRIs are more effective in treating depression is uncertain. It seems that some people respond better to SSRIs, while others respond better to SNRIs. Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta and Yentreve) and venlafaxine (Efexor).
