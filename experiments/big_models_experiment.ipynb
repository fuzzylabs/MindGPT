If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with Symptoms - Depression in adults.

The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page. Psychological symptoms. The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness. feeling hopeless and helpless. having low self-esteem. feeling tearful. feeling guilt-ridden. feeling irritable and intolerant of others. having no motivation or interest in things. finding it difficult to make decisions. not getting any enjoyment out of life. feeling anxious or worried. having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself.

It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong. Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are. how long depression lasts. the impact on are. how long depression lasts. the impact on your daily life. A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day. Try to get up at your normal time and stick to your routine as much as possible. Not having a routine can affect your eating. Try to carry on cooking and eating regular meals.

These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement.

Behavioural activation therapy focuses on identifying links Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression.

If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that What types are there? There are many different mental health problems.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day. Try to get up at your normal time and stick to your routine as much as possible. Not having a routine can affect your eating. Try to carry on cooking and eating regular meals. Seeking help for depression. Get help if you're still feeling down or depressed after a couple of weeks. Treatments for depression include talking therapies and antidepressants .

If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement.

If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis.

      "Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with Symptoms - Depression in adults. The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page. Psychological symptoms. The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness. feeling hopeless and helpless. having low self-esteem. feeling tearful. feeling guilt-ridden. feeling irritable and intolerant of others. having no motivation or interest in things. finding it difficult to make decisions. not getting any enjoyment out of life. feeling anxious or worried. having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself. Physical symptoms. The physical symptoms of depression include: moving or speaking more slowly than usual. changes in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased). constipation. unexplained aches and pains. lack of energy. low sex drive (loss of libido). disturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning. Social symptoms. The social symptoms of depression include: avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities. neglecting your hobbies and interests. having difficulties in your home, work or family life. Severities of depression. Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong. Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are. how long depression lasts. the impact on are. how long depression lasts. the impact on your daily life. A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily .

People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period.

These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement.

Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch.

Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day.

These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT).

If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life.

In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day. Try to get up at your normal time and stick to your routine as much as possible. Not having a routine can affect your eating. Try to carry on cooking and eating regular meals.

If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT).

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members.

Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day.

If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT).

If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day. Try to get up at your normal time and stick to your routine as much as possible. Not having a routine can affect your eating. Try to carry on cooking and eating regular meals.

CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT).

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day.

If you're diagnosed with depression, you might also be told that it is ‘less severe’ or ‘more severe’. This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time. Sometimes you might hear depression being called ‘major depressive disorder’. There are some other types of depression too: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). PDD is continuous depression that lasts for two years or more. You may also hear it called dysthymia or chronic depression. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). SAD is depression that What types are there? There are many different mental health problems. Some of them have similar symptoms, so you may experience the symptoms of more than one mental health problem, or be given several diagnoses at once. Or you might not have any particular diagnosis, but still be finding things very difficult. Everyone's experience is different and can change at different times. This page provides a brief description of a few mental health problems, and explains where you can find more information on them. Our A–Z of mental health has information on many more topics not listed here. Depression. Depression is a feeling of low mood that lasts for a long time and affects your everyday life. It can make you feel hopeless, despairing, guilty, worthless, unmotivated and exhausted. It can affect your self-esteem , sleep, appetite, sex drive and your physical health. In its mildest form, depression doesn't stop you leading a normal life, but it makes everything harder to do and seem less You may also experience 'mixed episodes'. This is when you have symptoms of mania and depression at the same time, or very quickly after each other. Episodes can vary in length. Some people have repeated episodes, but this doesn’t happen for everybody.  On my bad days, I felt I was a pathetic coward who didn't deserve to breathe, and on my good days I believed I was a god in waiting. Types of schizoaffective disorder. Bipolar type: You have manic episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. You may also experience depressive episodes. Depressive type: You only have depressive episodes alongside symptoms of psychosis. How is schizoaffective disorder different from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Schizoaffective disorder is its own diagnosis.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with Symptoms - Depression in adults. The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page. Psychological symptoms. The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness. feeling hopeless and helpless. having low self-esteem. feeling tearful. feeling guilt-ridden. feeling irritable and intolerant of others. having no motivation or interest in things. finding it difficult to make decisions. not getting any enjoyment out of life. feeling anxious or worried. having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself. Physical symptoms. The physical symptoms of depression include: moving or speaking more slowly than usual. changes in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased). constipation. unexplained aches and pains. lack of energy. low sex drive (loss of libido). disturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning. Social symptoms. The social symptoms of depression include: avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities. neglecting your hobbies and interests. having difficulties in your home, work or family life. Severities of depression. Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong. Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are. how long depression lasts. the impact on are. how long depression lasts. the impact on your daily life. A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol.

They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period.

If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Behavioural activation. Behavioural activation therapy focuses on identifying links Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms.

Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day.

CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT).

Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days.

Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\".

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day.

CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression.

It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement.

Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms.

At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay.

You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period. When to seek help. See a GP if you experience symptoms of medicines that treat the symptoms of depression. There are many different types of antidepressant. They have to be prescribed by a doctor, usually for depression that's moderate or severe. Combination therapy. A GP may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy, particularly if your depression is quite severe. A combination of an antidepressant and CBT usually works better than having just one of these treatments. Mental health teams. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Behavioural activation. Behavioural activation therapy focuses on identifying links Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people. How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with\n",

Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements.

Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood.

This describes how your symptoms are affecting you, and what treatment you're likely to be offered. You may find that the severity of your depression changes over time.

Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide.

Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day.

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with Symptoms - Depression in adults. The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page. Psychological symptoms. The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness. feeling hopeless and helpless. having low self-esteem. feeling tearful. feeling guilt-ridden. feeling irritable and intolerant of others. having no motivation or interest in things. finding it difficult to make decisions. not getting any enjoyment out of life. feeling anxious or worried. having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself. Physical symptoms. The physical symptoms of depression include: moving or speaking more slowly than usual. changes in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased). constipation. unexplained aches and pains. lack of energy. low sex drive (loss of libido). disturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning. Social symptoms. The social symptoms of depression include: avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities. neglecting your hobbies and interests. having difficulties in your home, work or family life. Severities of depression. Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell.

Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period.

Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults.

      "Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people . How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety . There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with Symptoms - Depression in adults. The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. If you're depressed, you may feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy. The symptoms persist for weeks or months and are bad enough to interfere with your work, social life and family life. There are many other symptoms of depression and you're unlikely to have all of those listed on this page. Psychological symptoms. The psychological symptoms of depression include: continuous low mood or sadness. feeling hopeless and helpless. having low self-esteem. feeling tearful. feeling guilt-ridden. feeling irritable and intolerant of others. having no motivation or interest in things. finding it difficult to make decisions. not getting any enjoyment out of life. feeling anxious or worried. having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming yourself. Physical symptoms. The physical symptoms of depression include: moving or speaking more slowly than usual. changes in appetite or weight (usually decreased, but sometimes increased). constipation. unexplained aches and pains. lack of energy. low sex drive (loss of libido). disturbed sleep – for example, finding it difficult to fall asleep at night or waking up very early in the morning. Social symptoms. The social symptoms of depression include: avoiding contact with friends and taking part in fewer social activities. neglecting your hobbies and interests. having difficulties in your home, work or family life. Severities of depression. Depression can often come on gradually, so it can be difficult to notice something is wrong. Many people try to cope with their symptoms without realising they're unwell. It can sometimes take a friend or family member to suggest something is wrong. Doctors describe depression in adults as either less severe (mild) or more severe (moderate or severe), based on: the symptoms, including how often you get symptoms and how bad they are. how long depression lasts. the impact on are. how long depression lasts. the impact on your daily life. A few people with severe depression may have symptoms of psychosis . You'll usually be asked to answer a set of questions to help doctors assess how severe your condition is. Grief and depression. It can be difficult to distinguish between grief and depression. They share many of the same characteristics, but there are important differences between them. Grief is an entirely natural response to a loss, while depression is an illness. People who are grieving may have symptoms of depression, but they usually improve with time. For some people, bereavement can lead to depression. If you're grieving it's normal to have feelings of sadness. Some other symptoms of depression are rare with grief and bereavement, such as having suicidal thoughts, symptoms of psychosis and feeling hopeless or guilt-ridden. Other types of depression. There are different types of depression, and some conditions where depression may be one of the symptoms. These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP. See tips on how to eat more healthily . Have a routine. When people feel down, they can get into poor sleep patterns, staying up late and sleeping during the day. Try to get up at your normal time and stick to your routine as much as possible. Not having a routine can affect your eating. Try to carry on cooking and eating regular meals. Seeking help for depression. Get help if you're still feeling down or depressed after a couple of weeks. Treatments for depression include talking therapies and antidepressants .

CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help.

      "Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it. Sharing a problem with someone else or with a group can give you job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason. Treating depression. Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression. Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise , cutting down on alcohol , giving up smoking and eating healthily . Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile. They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed. Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive. Information: Social care and support guide. If you: need help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability. care for someone regularly because they're ill or disabled, or because of their age – including family members. Our social care and support guide explains your options and where you can get support. How to cope with depression. Try these coping strategies if you're feeling depressed. Stay in touch. Don't withdraw from life. Socialising can improve your mood. Keeping in touch with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Be more active. Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day. Read about exercise for depression . Face your fears. Don't avoid the things you find difficult. When people feel low or anxious, they sometimes avoid talking to other people. Some people can lose their confidence in going out, driving or travelling. If this starts to happen, facing up to these situations will help them become easier. Don't drink too much alcohol. For some people, alcohol can become a problem. You may drink more than usual as a way of coping with or hiding your emotions, or just to fill time. But alcohol won't help you solve your problems and could also make you feel more depressed. Read some tips on cutting down on alcohol . Try to eat a healthy diet. Some people don't feel like eating when they're depressed and are at risk of becoming underweight. Others find comfort in food and can put on excess weight. Antidepressants can also affect your appetite. If you're concerned about weight loss, weight gain or how antidepressants are affecting your appetite, talk to your GP.

These include: postnatal depression – sometimes new mothers, fathers or partners develop depression after they have a baby; this is known as postnatal depression and it's treated in a similar way to other types of depression, with talking therapies and antidepressant medicines. bipolar disorder – also known as \"manic depression\", in bipolar disorder there are spells of both depression and excessively high mood (mania); the depression symptoms are similar to depression, but the bouts of mania can include harmful behaviour, such as gambling, going on spending sprees and having unsafe sex. seasonal affective disorder (SAD) – also known as \"winter depression\", SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern usually related to winter. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) – a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) where you have symptoms including feelings of depression and anxiety in the weeks before your period. When to seek help. See a GP if you experience symptoms of medicines that treat the symptoms of depression. There are many different types of antidepressant. They have to be prescribed by a doctor, usually for depression that's moderate or severe. Combination therapy. A GP may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy, particularly if your depression is quite severe. A combination of an antidepressant and CBT usually works better than having just one of these treatments. Mental health teams. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists. These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine. Talking therapies. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you. CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present. It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts – for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings. CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help. If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session. The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is. Interpersonal therapy (IPT). Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement. If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is. Behavioural activation. Behavioural activation therapy focuses on identifying links Overview - Depression in adults. Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days. Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can \"snap out of\" by \"pulling yourself together\". The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. These pages are about depression in adults. Read about depression in children and young people. How to tell if you have depression. Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms. They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful. Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety. There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains. The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe. At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living. Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times. A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression. When to see a doctor. It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed. Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery. What causes depression? Sometimes there's a trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on. People with\n",

      "Prompt to LLM : Context: Living with - Depression in adults. There are some key steps you can take to lift your mood and help your recovery from depression. Taking your medicine. It's very important to take your antidepressants as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. If you stop taking them too soon, your depression could return. Stopping suddenly can also increase the risk of withdrawal side effects. Talk to a doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about the medicine you're taking. The leaflet that comes with your medicine will have information about possible interactions with other medicines or supplements. Check with a doctor first if you plan to take any over-the-counter remedies such as painkillers, or any nutritional supplements. These can sometimes interfere with antidepressants. Diet and exercise. Exercise and a healthy diet can make a significant difference to how quickly you recover from depression. Both will improve your general health as well. A healthy diet can help lift your mood. In fact, eating healthily seems to be just as important for maintaining your mental health as it is for preventing physical health problems. Being physically active can lift your mood, reduce stress and anxiety, encourage the release of endorphins (your body's feel-good chemicals) and improve self-esteem. Exercising may also be a good distraction from negative thoughts, and it can improve social interaction. Mindfulness. It can be easy to rush through life without stopping to notice much. Paying more attention to the present moment – to your own thoughts and feelings, and to the world around you – can improve your mental wellbeing. Some people call this awareness \"mindfulness\", and you can take steps to develop it in your own life. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends group mindfulness and meditation as a treatment option for less severe depression. Talking about it.

Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is. If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress. This is known as \"watchful waiting\". They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help. Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) , may also be used for mild depression. For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine. Living with depression.
