MindGPT is a conversational system where users can ask mental health-orientated questions and receive answers which summarises content from two leading mental health websites: [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) and [NHS Mental Health](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/).

**It's not a digital counsellor or therapist and the output from the system should not be treated as such**, MindGPT is purely focused on acting as a gateway to vital information sources, summarising two authoritative perspectives and providing pointers to the original content.

In building this, we've drawn on our expertise in MLOps and prior experience in fine-tuning open-source LLMs for various tasks (see [here](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/matcha-examples/tree/main/llm) for an example of one tuned to summarise legal text). If you're interested in how MindGPT works under the hood and what technologies and data we've used, then take a look [here](docs/inside-mindgpt.md).

# &#8265; Why?

Mental health problems are something that everyone struggles with at various points in their life and finding the right type of help and information can be hard, even a blocker. [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/), one of the main mental health charities in the UK, puts this best: _when you're living with a mental health problem, or support someone who is, having access to the right information is vital_.

MindGPT sets out to increase ease of access to this information.
